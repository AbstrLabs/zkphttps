Verify a SXG:
- cert is valid
- SXG signature is valid
- HTTP response extraction (application specific)

cert is valid:
- issuer: from digicert issuer
- url: whitelist url
- sig: it's signed by digicert's pubkey 
- timestamp: zkp system has no concept of current timestamp, so to check timestamp there are two ways:
  - pass current time as a public input, add a constraint expire_timestamp < current timestamp. 
  - return the expire timestamp as a parameter and let verifier decide

Since with first approach, public input "current time" is provided by the prover, verifier still need to check
that "current time" is valid any way, so we'll use the second approach for simplicity
